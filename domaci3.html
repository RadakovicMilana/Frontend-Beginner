            <label><i>at place des Vosges</i></label>
            <p class="description">L'Ambroisie (French pronunciation: [lɑ̃bʁwazi]) is a traditional
                French restaurant in Paris, France founded by Bernard Pacaud
                and now run by his son Mathieu that has maintained three
                Michelin stars for more than thirty years. The name
                "L'Ambroisie" ("Ambrosia" in English) comes from Greek
                mythology and means both "food for gods" and "source of
                immortality."
                <br>
                <br>

                the Place des Vosges in Paris. In the 17th and 18th centuries,
                Place des Vosges was an upper-class and noble neighborhood.</p>

                <h3>Polidor</h3>
                <label><i>6th arrondissement of Paris</i></label>
                <p class="description">The Crémerie-Restaurant Polidor is a historic restaurant in the
                    6th arrondissement of Paris. Its predecessor was founded in
                    1845, and it has had its present name since the beginning of the
                    20th century.<br>
                    <br>
                    The interior of the restaurant is basically unchanged for over 100
                    years, and the style of cooking remains that of the late 19th
                    century. The Polidor is located at 41, rue Monsieur-le-Prince in
                    the Odéon area, near the Jardin du Luxembourg. Its name derives
                    from the cream desserts it served in former decades.</p>
